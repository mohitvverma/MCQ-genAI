This is called the musculoskeletal system. The skeleton supports and shapes the body and protects delicate internal organs such as the brain, heart and lungs.\\n\\nBones contain most of our body’s calcium supply. The body is constantly building up and breaking down bone tissue as required. Healthy bone needs a balanced diet, regular weight-bearing exercise and the right levels of various hormones.\\n\\n\\nThe human skeleton is made up of 206 bones, including bones of the:\\n\\nSkull – including the jaw bone\\nSpine – cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and tailbone (coccyx)\\nChest – ribs and breastbone (sternum)\\nArms – shoulder blade (scapula), collar bone (clavicle), humerus, radius and ulna\\nHands – wrist bones (carpals), metacarpals and phalanges\\nPelvis – hip bones\\nLegs – thigh bone (femur), kneecap (patella), shin bone (tibia) and fibula\\nFeet – tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges\\n\\n\\nThere are four different types of bone in the human body:\\n\\nLong bone – has a long, thin shape. Examples include the bones of the arms and legs (excluding the wrists, ankles and kneecaps). With the help of muscles, long bones work as levers to permit movement.\\nShort bone – has a squat, cubed shape. Examples include the bones that make up the wrists and the ankles.\\nFlat bone – has a flattened, broad surface. Examples include ribs, shoulder blades, breast bone and skull bones.\\nIrregular bone – has a shape that does not conform to the above three types. Examples include the bones of the spine (vertebrae).\\n\\n\\nThe different layers of bone tissue include:\\n\\nPeriosteum – the dense, tough outer shell that contains blood vessels and nerves\\nCompact or dense tissue – the hard, smooth layer that protects the tissue within\\nSpongy or cancellous tissue – the porous, honeycombed material found inside most bones, which allows the bone to be strong yet lightweight\\nBone marrow – the jelly-like substance found inside the cavities of some bones (including the pelvis) that produces blood cells.\\n'"

The skeleton supports and shapes the body and protects delicate internal organs such as the brain, heart and lungs.\\n\\nBones contain most of our body’s calcium supply. The body is constantly building up and breaking down bone tissue as required. Healthy bone needs a balanced diet, regular weight-bearing exercise and the right levels of various hormones.\\n\\n\\nThe human skeleton is made up of 206 bones, including bones of the:\\n\\nSkull – including the jaw bone\\nSpine – cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, sacrum and tailbone (coccyx)\\nChest – ribs and breastbone (sternum)\\nArms – shoulder blade (scapula), collar bone (clavicle), humerus, radius and ulna\\nHands – wrist bones (carpals), metacarpals and phalanges\\nPelvis – hip bones\\nLegs – thigh bone (femur), kneecap (patella), shin bone (tibia) and fibula\\nFeet – tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges\\n\\n\\nThere are four different types of bone in the human body:\\n\\nLong bone – has a long, thin shape. Examples include the bones of the arms and legs (excluding the wrists, ankles and kneecaps). With the help of muscles, long bones work as levers to permit movement.\\nShort bone – has a squat, cubed shape. Examples include the bones that make up the wrists and the ankles.\\nFlat bone – has a flattened, broad surface. Examples include ribs, shoulder blades, breast bone and skull bones.\\nIrregular bone – has a shape that does not conform to the above three types. Examples include the bones of the spine (vertebrae).\\n\\n\\nThe different layers of bone tissue include:\\n\\nPeriosteum – the dense, tough outer shell that contains blood vessels and nerves\\nCompact or dense tissue – the hard, smooth layer that protects the tissue within\\nSpongy or cancellous tissue – the porous, honeycombed material found inside most bones, which allows the bone to be strong yet lightweight\\nBone marrow – the jelly-like substance found inside the cavities of some bones (including the pelvis) that produces blood cells.\\n',\n",
